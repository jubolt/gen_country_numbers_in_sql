# gen_country_numbers_in_sql
generated country nombers to sql database

Everything is described in the script, you can change the operator codes for the country, the number of numbers, and the operators themselves.

The script runs for a long time, there is no logging, as this would affect the speed. Especially since there is nothing special to log.
